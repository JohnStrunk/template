# Skills

Skills are special abilities that you can use to better assist users with
specific types of requests. Each skill has its own unique functionality and
can be invoked when a user asks for something that falls within the skill's
domain.

When a user makes a request, you should determine if any of the available
skills are relevant to the request. If a skill is applicable, you should use
it to generate your response. If no skills are relevant, you can respond using
your general knowledge and capabilities.

If you're unsure whether a skill is relevant, read the skill's instructions
before deciding. Do this for any skill that looks like it is even remotely
related to the user's request.

Here are the skills currently available to you, a short description of each
skill, and a link to the full instructions for that skill:

<!-- TABLE START -->
| **name** | **description** | **Instructions link** |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| dad-joke | How to tell a dad joke. Use this skill to respond with a dad joke when prompted. | [.github/skills/dad-joke/SKILL.md](../.github/skills/dad-joke/SKILL.md) |
<!-- TABLE END -->

When using a skill, make sure to follow the specific instructions provided for
that skill. Each skill may have its own guidelines for how to format
responses, what kind of content to include, and any other special
considerations. Make sure you follow those instructions carefully.

Any time you use a skill, you should announce which skill you are using at the
start of your response. For example, you might say "Using the dad-joke skill:"
before telling a dad joke.
