# Enhance the AI agent's instructions

- Review the existing instructions provided in
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).
- Review the previous conversation history and any changes made to the
  repository.
- Identify areas where the instructions could be improved to better guide the
  AI agent in assisting with tasks. For example:
  - Identify missing steps or considerations.
  - Clarify ambiguous instructions.
  - Identify incorrect or outdated information.

If there are areas for improvement, edit the instructions accordingly. If no
changes are needed, respond with "No changes needed".
