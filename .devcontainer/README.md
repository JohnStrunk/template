# Devcontainer info

This is a starter template for a devcontainer. It has enough to allow editing
this repository in a container.

Currently, renovatebot doesn't permit comments in the devcontainer.json file, so
the documentation that would normally be there is in this README.md file
instead. See: [renovate discussion
28794](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/28794)

## Configuration

- [Devcontainer specfication](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/)
- [Base images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images)
- [Available "features"](https://containers.dev/features)
